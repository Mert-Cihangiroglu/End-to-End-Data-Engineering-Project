# End to End Data Engineering Project
 Spark Streaming, Kafka and Cassandra are used.


## Requirements

I did set up an Linux Ubuntu VM on my local to perform all the tasks, you can use AWS, or GCP cloud instances as well.

First install and setup the below packages.

spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7

apache-cassandra-3.9

kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0
