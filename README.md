# End to End Data Engineering Project
 Spark Streaming, Kafka and Cassandra are used.


## Requirements

I did set up a Linux Ubuntu VM on my local to perform all the tasks. You can use AWS, or GCP cloud instances as well.Once your machine is ready to go, go ahead, install and setup the below packages.

- spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7

- apache-cassandra-3.9

- kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0
